<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The Boomi Platform Enhancer Extension came about from the need to adjust the current default Boomi Web Platform IDE and display to provide a more desirable layout and adjustments to make development and general usage with in the Boomi Cloud platform more robust. 


Here's why:
* I wanted more functionality and better overall setup; so instead of waiting I just did.
* Boomi takes community feedback however its not perfect and unless its gets a score of XXX it does not really get a look at and to me these feel a must.


### Built With
The main frameworks of this extension and IDE used to build this extension.
* [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
* [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

* [Firefox Browser Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/boomi-platform-enhancer/)

and install the addon; once done it will auto-enable when on the Boomi Web Platform.

## Usage

The following provides the current abilities of the released extension for use within the Boomi Web Platform:

* Keyboard Shortcuts
  * Ctrl+Alt + S = Save Current Flow
  * Ctrl+Alt + T = Test Current Flow
  * ~ = Toggle Full Screen - On/Off
* Adjustments to the portal for integration around font sizing, header and menu sizing to provide more build and processing space within the default view.
* Account dashboard now defaults to 7 days instead of the maximum value.
* Shapes that don't have a end connection will glow.
* Quickly add stop shape to flow by hovering over end arrow and clicking stop.
* Add components directly within the build tab by double clicking the flow and selecting from a drop down.
* Capture the entire flow without resize and save to a local image by using the "Capture Process Flow" button above the build canvas.
* Hover over flow shape to see the connection points it make.
* Use notes to group tasks and provide information relating to multiple areas of the flow.
* Add Markdown in the process description or notes to show better visual formatting.
* When tables (for example Process Reporting list view) is displayed there's an option to "Toggle Line Wrapping" available to maximize screen real estate.
* Ability to assign keyboard button to easily go into and out of Full Screen Mode - default is the `~` key.
* JSON & XML Viewing toggle added to Message and Notify Shapes; will format the JSON and add the ' quote padding automatically.
* Capture a diagram of your process flow easily via the "Capture Process Flow" button; will capture the entire flow and save an image to a local file.
  * Options available are - Use Transparent Background, Zoom Size and Ability to Expand all notes to capture the note detail
* Debug has been enhanced to provide more robust coloring, this includes glowing colors, item selection and error emphasis.
* Ability to Remove the Canvas Build Background (dots) which works well with dark modes.
* Save Reminder – When packaging a component you will be reminded to save the process as Boomi doesn't save automatically when packaging.
* Schedule Reminder - Once a deployment has occurred or been deployed to another environment the notification message will also provide a reminder to setup a schedule (if enabled).
* Easily copy the current Component URL/ID using the Copy Component ID Button (In the ⚙️ action button above the build canvas).
* Build Shape "connector" Pallet has been restored back to its better life before Boomi UX decided to change it and make it unusable.
* Enable the selection of Icon Sets within the option to define user experience instead of default Boomi UX.
* In Process Reporting, Pending Executions runtime clock/timer now auto-updates - Note: Auto Refresh must be turned on for this to work.
* Define a custom refresh period and have process reporting auto refresh to your needs.
* Expand the Element Selection Screen within Shapes to provide more visual room for ease of use.
* Platform Status Detail - Shows if operational or if any Boomi systems are not operational.
* Brand new code editor attached to Message, Notify and Command Shape, click Edit message to open up a dedicated code window with choice of code display
* Tab names remove the account name to enable better display of tabs function i.e. Build, Reporting etc. Toggle Option Available.
* New Icon against Drop Down Menu items i.e. Manage to allow you to click and open in new tab instead of the same window.
* Default SQL Editor in Data Base Operation code area is now resizable for use with larger screens.
